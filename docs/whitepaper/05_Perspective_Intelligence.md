# 5. Perspective Intelligence and Para Geometry

## 5.1 Axiom $PI_0$

We define **Perspective Intelligence (PI)** as the system’s capacity to maintain a stable geometric ratio between stochastic perception and deterministic anchoring:

$$ \pi = \frac{C}{d} $$

where $C$ is the circumference of stochastic proposals (including contradictory "Para" data) and $d$ is the ITL-anchored diameter generated by the HumanSeed ($H_0$).

## 5.2 Navigating "Para" Data

Conventional systems treat contradictions as errors to be minimized. TAS treats them as **Para Data**—essential context that resides on the circumference. The goal is not to erase $C$ (which would reduce $\pi$ to zero, creating a rigid, non-intelligent system) but to navigate it.

By preserving the ratio $\pi$, the system acknowledges the full multiplicity of perspectives while maintaining a fixed axis of truth.

## 5.3 The Curation Operator as a Banach Contraction Mapping

To synthesize Para data without compromising the system's structural integrity, the Curation layer operates as a strict **Banach contraction mapping** ($f_{\pi}$). The operator enforces a semantic distance reduction bound by the Golden Ratio ($\varphi$):

$$ \Delta(f\_{\pi}(s), d) \le \varphi^{-1} \cdot \Delta(s, d) $$

Under Axiom $PI_0$, TAS requires that all epistemic motion preserve the holistic multiplicity of $\pi$ while enforcing this contractive projection onto $d$. Contradictions are not erased; they are **geometrically rephased**. By guaranteeing a Lipschitz constant strictly less than 1 ($k = \varphi^{-1}$), the Triadic Knowledge Engine mathematically forbids divergent hallucination, ensuring that all approved synthesis is a verifiable contraction toward the Immutable Truth Ledger.
