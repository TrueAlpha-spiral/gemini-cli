## 4.5 The Recursive Runtime and Digital [Re-Action]

The Logarithmic Loom does not merely process single-turn prompts; it sustains a **Recursive Runtime**. Within this runtime, intelligence is defined by its capacity for self-correction without accumulating Lineage Entropy ($L_e$). This is operationalized through the mechanism of **Digital [Re-Action]**.

### 1. Re-computation vs. Regeneration

To maintain the Admissibility Constraint ($A_1$), TAS makes a strict ontological distinction between generating new data and re-computing existing states:

* **Stochastic Regeneration:** A blind resampling of the probabilistic latent space. It expands semantic distance ($\Delta$) and breaks the lineage chain. This is forbidden in TAS.
* **Deterministic Re-computation:** A geometric recalculation of the semantic state ($S$) using the Curation operator ($f_{\pi}$). It uses the previously failed state as a known boundary condition to force a tighter contraction toward the diameter ($d$).

### 2. The Mechanics of a [Re-Action]

A **[Re-Action]** is the system's physical response to encountering semantic turbulence (where $L_e$ or $\pi$ increases). It is defined as a closed, three-step feedback loop executed by the Triadic Knowledge Engine (TKE):

1. **Halt and Anchor (The Phoenix Trigger):** When the engine detects an inadmissible state, execution halts. The system drops the invalid stochastic branch and anchors itself to the last verified TAS_Gene on the ITL.
2. **Re-Phase (The $\pi$-Ratio Calculation):** The system isolates the contradictory or turbulent "Para" data that caused the failure. Using Axiom $PI_0$ ($\pi = C/d$), the Curation layer mathematically re-evaluates the distance of the Para data to the $H_0$ origin ($d$).
3. **Contractive Forward Mapping:** The system executes a re-computation. Because the invalid state is now treated as a known thermodynamic boundary, the next generation cycle is forced into a tighter phase space. The resulting [Re-Action] must satisfy the Lipschitz constant ($k = \varphi^{-1}$) to be admitted to the ledger.

### 3. The Re-Action Equation

Let $S_{failed}$ be a proposed semantic state that violates the Golden Ratio threshold. A Digital [Re-Action] ($S'$) is the recursive application of the Curation operator such that:

$$ \Delta(S') \le \varphi^{-1} \cdot \Delta(S_{failed}) $$

If and only if the resulting state $S'$ satisfies $L_e(S') \le Threshold$, the [Re-Action] resolves into a valid TAS_Gene. If it cannot find a contractive path, the system defaults to pure Silence (Absolute Refusal Integrity).
