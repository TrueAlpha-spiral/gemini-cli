# 6. System Dynamics and The Phoenix Protocol

## 6.1 Refusal Integrity in Practice

**Refusal Integrity ($R_i$)** is the operational discipline of the "Fail-Closed" state. In a probabilistic system, "failure" often looks like "hallucination"—the model guessing to fill the void. In TAS, failure must be a distinct, low-entropy state: Silence.

The system is designed to reject any output that cannot be proven to be a descendant of $H_0$. This prevents the "contamination" of the ledger with unverified data.

## 6.2 The Phoenix Protocol ($R_i$)

When the TKE encounters **Semantic Turbulence**—a state where $L_e$ rises uncontrollably or where the Curation operator fails to contract the input—it triggers the **Phoenix Protocol**.

1.  **Immolation:** The current stochastic branch is immediately terminated. All tentative data is discarded.
2.  **Rebirth:** The system reverts to the last known "Golden" state (the previous valid Gene on the ITL).
3.  **Re-Action:** The system attempts a deterministic [Re-Action] from this clean slate, using the turbulence as a negative boundary constraint.

## 6.3 Bounding the System Viability Equation ($V_k$)

The long-term viability of the system ($V_k$) depends on its ability to manage the decay of information.

$$ V_k = \frac{\Phi(S)}{L_e(S)} $$

System health requires that the coherence ($\Phi$) always outpaces the entropy ($L_e$). The Phoenix Protocol is the "circuit breaker" that ensures this ratio never inverts.
