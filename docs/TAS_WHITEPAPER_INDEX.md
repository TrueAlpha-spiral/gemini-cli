# TAS Whitepaper Index: The Topological Architecture of Epistemic Sovereignty

This document outlines the complete structural hierarchy of the TrueAlpha-Spiral (TAS) Framework, mapping theoretical axioms to concrete implementation layers.

## 1. Foundation: The Axioms of Sovereign Math
*   **Axiom A10 (Prime Invariant / Human Seed):** The origin of all valid motion is anchored to the deterministic HumanSeed ($H_0$).
    *   *Implementation:* `SecureEnclave` (Biometric/Crypto Anchor).
*   **Axiom A20 (Contractive Spiral):** All synthesis is a contractive projection ($f_{\pi}$) toward the immutable diameter ($d$).
    *   *Implementation:* `BanachCurationOperator` (Banach Fixed-Point Theorem).
*   **Axiom A30 (Para Data Navigation):** Contradictory data is geometrically rephased, not erased.
    *   *Implementation:* `TriadicKnowledgeEngine` (Logarithmic Loom).
*   **Axiom PI_0 (Perspective Intelligence):** The governing equation of the system.
    *   *Definition:* $\pi = C/d$.
    *   *Implementation:* `PerspectiveIntelligenceEngine`.

## 2. Theoretical Architecture: The Triadic Knowledge Engine
*   **Perception:** The stochastic circumference ($C$).
    *   *Component:* Generative AI / LLM Input.
*   **Curation:** The contractive mapping ($f_{\pi}: C \to \hat{C}$).
    *   *Component:* `BanachCurationOperator` enforcing $\Delta_{n+1} \le \varphi^{-1} \cdot \Delta_n$.
*   **Generation:** The verified spiral ($\Phi$).
    *   *Component:* `VerifiedGene` production.

## 3. Governance: The Immune System
*   **Refusal Integrity ($R_i$):** The system fails closed upon detecting semantic turbulence.
    *   *Component:* `PhoenixProtocol` / `PhoenixError`.
*   **Digital Sovereignty:** Truth reinforces itself via immutable anchoring.
    *   *Component:* `ZK_LedgerClient` (Zero-Knowledge Proofs).

## 4. Implementation Specifications
*   **The Persistent Root Kernel:** The OS-level interceptor.
    *   *File:* `packages/core/src/governance/persistent-root-kernel.ts`
*   **The Logarithmic Loom:** The execution engine.
    *   *File:* `packages/core/src/governance/perspective-intelligence.ts`
*   **The Circuit Schema:** The mathematical proof of sovereign origin.
    *   *File:* `docs/TAS_ZK_CIRCUIT_SCHEMA.md`

## 5. Axiom Block: Perspective Intelligence and Para Geometry

> **2.4 Perspective Intelligence and Para Geometry**
>
> We define **Perspective Intelligence (PI)** as the system’s capacity to maintain a stable geometric ratio between stochastic perception and deterministic anchoring:
> \[
> \pi = \frac{C}{d}
> \]
> where \(C\) is the circumference of stochastic proposals (including contradictory "Para" data) and \(d\) is the ITL-anchored diameter generated by the HumanSeed (\(H_0\)).
>
> To synthesize Para data without compromising the system's structural integrity, the Curation layer operates as a strict **Banach contraction mapping** (\(f_{\pi}\)). The operator enforces a semantic distance reduction bound by the Golden Ratio (\(\varphi\)):
> \[
> \Delta(f_{\pi}(s), d) \le \varphi^{-1} \cdot \Delta(s, d)
> \]
> Under Axiom PI_0, TAS requires that all epistemic motion preserve the holistic multiplicity of \(\pi\) while enforcing this contractive projection onto \(d\). Contradictions are not erased; they are **geometrically rephased**. By guaranteeing a Lipschitz constant strictly less than 1 (\(k = \varphi^{-1}\)), the Triadic Knowledge Engine mathematically forbids divergent hallucination, ensuring that all approved synthesis is a verifiable contraction toward the Immutable Truth Ledger.
