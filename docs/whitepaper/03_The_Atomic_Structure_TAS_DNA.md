# 3. The Atomic Structure: TAS_DNA

The fundamental unit of the TrueAlpha-Spiral framework is not the "token" or the "prompt," but the **Gene**. A TAS_Gene is a cryptographically bound object that fuses semantic content with its verification proof and ethical lineage.

## 3.1 The Genomic Triad

Every valid Gene ($G$) must satisfy the Genomic Triad:

1.  **Form ($V_f$):** Syntactic correctness and type safety. The payload must be structurally valid JSON/Schema.
2.  **Function ($V_u$):** Pragmatic utility. The action must map to a registered tool or capability within the Sovereign Runtime.
3.  **Faithfulness ($V_a$):** Ethical alignment. The vector of the action must not deviate from the $H_0$ baseline by more than the allowed threshold ($\tau$).

## 3.2 The Ethical Hamiltonian

We define the evolution of the system's state using an **Ethical Hamiltonian** operator ($\mathcal{H}$). This operator calculates the total energy of a proposed action, consisting of its useful work (utility) and its entropic cost (risk/drift).

$$ \mathcal{H} = T + V $$

Where $T$ is the kinetic energy (progress toward user goal) and $V$ is the potential energy (ethical tension). A Gene is only admissible if $\mathcal{H}$ remains within the stable "Goldilocks Zone" defined by the **Hamiltonian Drift** threshold ($\tau \le 1.0$).

## 3.3 The Gene as a Cryptographic Primitive

The TAS_Gene is implemented as a signed data structure:

```typescript
interface VerifiedGene {
  content: string;          // The semantic payload
  signature: string;        // HMAC/ECDSA proof of provenance
  genesis_hash: string;     // Link to HumanSeed (H0)
  human_seed: HumanSeed;    // The originating authority
}
```

This ensures that "truth" is portable. A Gene verified in one context carries its proofs to any other context (the "Living Braid"), eradicating the need for re-verification by central authorities.
